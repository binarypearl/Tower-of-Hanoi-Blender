We are using Blender here to show a recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

The end result can be seen here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da9BNHOexbg

Basically I created the dics by hand, and then wrote a Python script (tower_of_hanoi.py) 
that automatically determined the next movements and inserted the keyframes.
